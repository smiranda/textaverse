You wake up. You are in a small, dark cavernous room. There's a lit wooden torch flaming softly through the cold walls, which are covered in lushy moss. You've known only this place all your life, about 3 steps wide and deep. You're fed once a day a bowl of cold mushy moss soup at about this time. 

Today, the soup hasn't been given yet, but in the small openning in the wall where the bowl is usually put there's something else... A worm ?

> *

> eat worm

[(eat, worm)]

You eat the worm.

[event(eat, worm)]
[overseer catches event]
[overseer moves to door]

A large stumpy caveman approaches on the other side of the wall.

[overseer speaks]

"Ugh Ugh where pet worm ? Where pet worm ???"

He lifts the giant stone slab which was the front wall and keeps it above head, desperate to find his pet worm.
